## Self Critique

+++

### What did we do well?
- Good team communication
- Everyone showed up when necessary
- Always willing to help
- Website would scale well (sorting on backend)
- Allows future expansion

+++

### What did we learn?
- React isn't super pleasnt to work with, some features lack documentation
- GitBook needs to hire new web developers (they're hiring: [job listings](https://gitbook.workable.com/))
- It's very important to plan early and have a design in mind before you start writing code
- Don't underestimate the difficulty of a particular issue, it may take more time than you intend

+++

### What can we do better?
- Have firm deadlines for tasks
- Time estimating is hard, but we got better with it over time
- Plan for expansion earlier rather than later

+++

### What puzzles us?
- Some of the tools that were required seem unnecessary
    - Tools which aren't industry standard
- What is a better way to connect data together
    - Our process was somewhat manual, even though our data set is fairly large

## Other Critique

+++

### What did they do well?
- Their design looked very good, similar to what an actual wiki would look like
    - Even from the start of the project, their site looked good
    - In contrast, ours started kinda ugly, and improved slightly
- Site was easy and intuitive to navigate

+++

### What did we learn from their website?
- The look of a site can make users feel a certain way about it
    - More appealing visual design made us feel like their website would probably function better as well

+++

### What can they do better?
- Their site didn't have that much data from the API's they scraped through many of the phases
- Their site doesn't offer many options for sorting models
- Their design is really good, but could use a bit of polish in a couple places

+++

### What puzzles us about their website?
- How were the external links for their model instances found? 
- How they implemented the filtering interface on their site

## Visualization

- Exercise the API of another group in an interesting and useful way
- Use D3
- The page must have a clear English description and be rendered attractively
